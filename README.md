Tessera 

Overview

Tessera pronounced (teh-sr-uh) originates from the Greek language and it was created to ensure that users can create secure passwords for work or personal devices. It is important to have long randomized passwords for your devices because most fraud and ransomware attacks happen due to outdated passwords, extended across multiple applications. In addition, it can be tedious to constantly change and think of new passwords that meet the requirements of most sites. We aim to take that burden off your shoulders by providing 2 types of random passwords that generate at the click of a button. 

Average Password Requirements 
•	8 or 9 characters long 
•	Includes uppercase and lowercase letters 
•	Includes one number 
•	Includes one special character 


Project Description 

For this project, the Passwordinator API (https://github.com/fawazsullia/password-generator/) was used to call the random combination of letters and numbers. Two endpoints were used to display the capability of this API. 

The first endpoint or (password option) is a 12-letter long password of random letters, including capital and lowercase. This password option would be good to add to a meaningful word or number(s) you have in mind, since most password syntaxes ask that you include at least one number and special character. To add, the longer the password, the more secure it is so this is an easy way to enhance security of your passwords. 

The second endpoint or (password option) is a 10-character long password consisting of uppercase & lowercase letters, numbers and special characters all random. This option is good if you have trouble thinking of a password that meets the average password syntax. This is also a good option for passwords that need to be renewed after a certain amount of time. For example, most jobs require that you change your password after a certain number of days or months, and this can become a headache if you struggle creating meaningful passwords that meet the average syntax. Tessera helps to resolve this issue. However, be mindful that some passwords created in this section may contain special characters that are not allowed in passwords. For best practice, always use the special characters at the top of the keyboard, same line as the numbers 0-9. These special characters are always accepted in passwords, try to stay away from using the other ones. We suggest that if your password does have alternate special characters, copy and paste password and replace alternate with a special character from the suggested row above.

Minimum Need-To-Have Features 
For this project, the minimum need to have features consisted of 
•	Be a working, interactive React app, built using create react app.
•	Utilize React Router, installed via NPM.
•	Have at least 6 separate, rendered components (not including App and Services).
•	Implement an organized and understandable React file structure.
•	Utilize functional components appropriately.
•	Use Axios to consume data from an third party API, and render that data in your components. 
•	Must us React Hooks
•	Must use at least two different endpoint


Post MVP 
In the future, I’d like to implement a copy button that will allow the user to copy the desired password. Along with this, I would display an alert message notifying that the password has been copied. A password manager would also be a good addition to this website. However, that would require some user authentication to log in which would add more value and security to the overall app.
